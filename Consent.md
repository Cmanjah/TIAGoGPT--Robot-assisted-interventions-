Dear user,

#### Introduction
This system, TIAGoGPT you are about to use is an MSc research project on "Exploring the Potentials of LLMs in TIAGo Robot-Assisted Interventions to Support Children with Social Skill Difficulties". The project implements cutting-edge technologies to revolutionise the field of child support. We employed state-of-the-art large language models in robotic assistive interventions for children with social skill difficulties. This means that the project system is deployed on a robot, and as part of our research study, children are expected to interact with the robot to enable us reimagine the potentials of this robot.

#### Mode
In line with our testing procedures, we want participants (from different backgrounds) to engage with the TIAGoGPT in at least a 10-minute conversation by asking the robot different questions exploratively while the system provides possible answers.

#### Consent Request
 In the light of the above, We write requesting your consent to collect and use data, including text and voice prompts, as part of our research study. Your participation and feedback are crucial as your responses will contribute to an academic research study exploring the potentials of LLMs in TIAGo Robot-Assisted Interventions (RAI) for supporting children with social skill difficulties.

#### What Data Will Be Collected
1. Text Prompts: 
    We may collect data in the form of text responses provided by you through the Tiago Robot - 'TIAGoGPT' software. These responses will be used for further academic research into natural language processing area.

2. Voice Prompts: 
    We may also collect voice recordings from you, which will be used for further academic research into natural language processing, speech recognition and transcription system areas.

#### How We Will Use the Data 
The data collected will be used solely for academic research studies and the purposes mentioned above. We will never share your data with any commercial or third party without obtaining your explicit consent unless required by law.

#### Data Storage and Security
Your data will be stored securely, and we will take all reasonable precautions to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.

#### Duration of Data Retention 
There is no specific retention period for the data collected in this study. However, we will review and regularly assess the need for retaining the data to ensure it aligns with the objectives of our research. Should we no longer require the data for the stated purposes, it will be securely and permanently deleted from our records.

#### Your Right to Withdraw Consent
Participation in data collection is entirely voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent or have your data removed, please contact us at the TIAGo robot team, university of bradford to initiate the process.


By agreeing to this consent request, you confirm that you are of legal age to provide consent for yourself or on behalf of a minor, or if you are under the age of consent in your jurisdiction, you have obtained permission from your parent or legal guardian.
